This includes damage, survivability, buffing, and everything. The relative strength of the ship does not matter; a +50% damage boost for a weak ship should be rated the same as a +50% damage boost for a strong ship.\n<h3>Worth</h3>\nWorth is subjective. If you must use a waifu no matter what, then of course her augment would be very much worth. So the \"worth\" ratings in the table roughly follows this rubric:\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<li><img src=\"/guides/augment_images/S.webp\" alt=\"S\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Has sizeable gain for a ship who sees various endgame use.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/guides/augment_images/A.webp\" alt=\"A\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Has sizeable gain for a ship who is good in at least some endgame content and has few other substitutes.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/guides/augment_images/B.webp\" alt=\"B\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Makes the ship useful for midgame to lategame.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/guides/augment_images/C.webp\" alt=\"C\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Makes the ship decent but not meta.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/guides/augment_images/D.webp\" alt=\"D\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Worse than or equal to purple augments, or the augmented ship would still be bad.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New SKK</h3>\nRates \"worth\" for new players, covering your first two or three unique augments or until you reach \"midgame\" (farming Chapter 12 or beating Abyssal zones). Obviously, do not craft the unique augment of a ship you don't own.... <strong>This tier list should not force you to obtain a ship.</strong>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<li><img src=\"/guides/augment_images/S.webp\" alt=\"S\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> The most important in helping a new player reach midgame.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/guides/augment_images/A.webp\" alt=\"A\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Very helpful for a new player to reach midgame.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/guides/augment_images/B.webp\" alt=\"B\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Good to have as a new player but maybe a bit out of order.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/guides/augment_images/C.webp\" alt=\"C\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Diverts resources away from far more important augments or outlives its usefulness quickly.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/guides/augment_images/D.webp\" alt=\"D\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Simply a waste of augment resources for a new player.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Collabs</h3>\nCollab augments are cheaper to max level, and this cheapness is included in both \"worth\" ratings for all players and for new players.

Due to the 1.5s start of battle delay, if your faster CV has exactly 20.0s reload, the screen clear will happen 0.5s after the boss fires the true damage barrage. If your vanguard is too close to the boss due to RNG, then they'll die in that 0.5s. So you want CVs to reload slightly faster than 20s but not so fast that the CVs strike before the barrage appears.","type":"SimpleText"}]},{"type":"Paragraph","content":[{"text":"Or just be a normal person and use the other fleets.","type":"SimpleText"}]},{"src":"/./inserts/lite_pUJ_2eke4sI.html","previewMarker":"november-pm1","fit":true,"type":"Iframe"}]}],"lastModifiedTime":1736110881642,"tocItem":{"chapterTitle":"Challenge Mode","pageTitle":"November Challenge","pageMeta":{"title":["November Challenge"]},"dirName":"challengemode","fileName":"november","fileExtension":"md","viewOnRelativePath":null,"pageSectionIdTitles":[{"title":"Strategy","id":"strategy","customAnchorId":"strategy"},{"title":"Mid-End BB","id":"mid-end-bb","customAnchorId":"mid-end-bb"},{"title":"High-End BB 1","id":"high-end-bb-1","customAnchorId":"high-end-bb-1"},{"title":"High-End BB 2","id":"high-end-bb-2","customAnchorId":"high-end-bb-2"},{"title":"French","id":"french","customAnchorId":"french"},{"title":"Mid-End CV","id":"mid-end-cv","customAnchorId":"mid-end-cv"},{"title":"Very High-End CV","id":"very-high-end-cv","customAnchorId":"very-high-end-cv"}]}},{"type":"Page","content":[{"bulletMarker":"*","tight":true,"type":"BulletList","content":[{"type":"ListItem","content":[{"type":"Paragraph","content":[{"id":"info","type":"Icon"},{"text":" Read the  ","type":"SimpleText"},{"url":"https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Extreme_Challenge#Sagittarius","isFile":false,"type":"Link","content":[{"text":"boss skills and stats on wiki","type":"SimpleText"}]}]}]},{"type":"ListItem","content":[{"type":"Paragraph","content":[{"id":"info","type":"Icon"},{"text":" Read the  ","type":"SimpleText"},{"url":"/./challengemode/challenge-mode","isFile":false,"type":"Link","content":[{"text":"common introduction and disclaimers","type":"SimpleText"}]}]}]},{"type":"ListItem","content":[{"type":"Paragraph","content":[{"stroke":"red","id":"clock","type":"Icon"},{"text":" Timing precision: Medium ","type":"SimpleText"},{"stroke":"orange","id":"minus","type":"Icon"}]}]},{"type":"ListItem","content":[{"type":"Paragraph","content":[{"fill":"yellow","stroke":"yellow","id":"zap","type":"Icon"},{"text":" DPS check: Medium ","type":"SimpleText"},{"stroke":"orange","id":"minus","type":"Icon"}]}]},{"type":"ListItem","content":[{"type":"Paragraph","content":[{"fill":"blue","stroke":"blue","id":"shield","type":"Icon"},{"text":" Tank check: Hard ","type":"SimpleText"},{"stroke":"red","id":"chevron-up","type":"Icon"}]}]}]},{"id":"strategy","additionalIds":[],"title":"Strategy","type":"Section","content":[{"type":"Paragraph","content":[{"text":"First, read the boss skills if you haven't.
