This includes damage, survivability, buffing, and everything. The relative strength of the ship does not matter; a +50% damage boost for a weak ship should be rated the same as a +50% damage boost for a strong ship.\n<h3>Worth</h3>\nWorth is subjective. If you must use a waifu no matter what, then of course her augment would be very much worth. So the \"worth\" ratings in the table roughly follows this rubric:\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<li><img src=\"/images/ranks/S.webp\" alt=\"S\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Has sizeable gain for a ship who sees various endgame use.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/images/ranks/A.webp\" alt=\"A\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Has sizeable gain for a ship who is good in at least some endgame content and has few other substitutes.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/images/ranks/B.webp\" alt=\"B\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Makes the ship useful for midgame to lategame.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/images/ranks/C.webp\" alt=\"C\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Makes the ship decent but not meta.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/images/ranks/D.webp\" alt=\"D\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Worse than or equal to purple augments, or the augmented ship would still be bad.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>New SKK</h3>\nRates \"worth\" for new players, covering your first two or three unique augments or until you reach \"midgame\" (farming Chapter 12 or beating Abyssal zones). Obviously, do not craft the unique augment of a ship you don't own.... <strong>And this tier list should not force you to obtain a ship. Just because an augment is S-tier doesn't mean you should try your hardest to get that ship.</strong>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: none\">\n<li><img src=\"/images/ranks/S.webp\" alt=\"S\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> The most important in helping a new player reach midgame.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/images/ranks/A.webp\" alt=\"A\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Very helpful for a new player to reach midgame.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/images/ranks/B.webp\" alt=\"B\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Good to have as a new player but maybe a bit out of order.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/images/ranks/C.webp\" alt=\"C\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Diverts resources away from far more important augments or outlives its usefulness quickly.</li>\n<li><img src=\"/images/ranks/D.webp\" alt=\"D\" style=\"height: 24px; vertical-align: middle; display: inline-block;\"> Simply a waste of augment resources for a new player.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Collabs</h3>\nCollab augments are cheaper to max level, and this cheapness is included in both \"worth\" ratings for all players and for new players. If an old collab augment is said to be worth for new players, obviously new new players can't get them (or the ships) anymore. So it is just there for new players who got the ship and augment, then quit the game and recently returned.\n</details>","isInlined":false,"type":"EmbeddedHtml"}]},{"id":"purple-augments","additionalIds":[],"title":"Purple Augments","type":"Section","content":[{"type":"Paragraph","content":[{"text":"Note: New players should save up for impactful unique augments instead of crafting or upgrading blue/purple augments.","type":"SimpleText"}]},{"src":"/./inserts/purple-augment-table.html","previewMarker":"augment-modules-pm1","fit":true,"type":"Iframe"}]},{"id":"untiered-unique-augments","additionalIds":[],"title":"Untiered Unique Augments","type":"Section","content":[{"type":"Paragraph","content":[{"text":"These are special cases.
