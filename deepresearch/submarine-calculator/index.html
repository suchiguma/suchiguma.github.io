<header><h1>Salvo Reload Calculator</h1></header>
<p>Usage instructions are below the calculator This is the best submarine reload calculator on the market and it s free For damage estimations to learn the effects of oxytorps tech and cats on damage consult AL Calculator by MrLar For reload times of non submarines also use that calculator The general workflow is Select the Preset Ship Select the affinity For &lt;100 or oathed and &lt;200 you re out of luck and should type in the Base RLD manually Base reload assumes level 125 But Level 120 is close enough usually only a difference of 1 or 2 Type it manually if you care Add your cat talents and gear like Oxytorps Skill percentages should be covered by the Preset but there are exceptions like a non full wolfpack Base and Add Oxygen should be covered by the Preset Do not add Snorkel oxygen Checking the OpSi box will add 20 oxygen If you use one but not the other cat in Operation Siren uncheck the box and type the value in Add Warning The non Snorkel loadouts do NOT assume that Oxytorp is used in place of it You need to manually add 10 RLD for 10 or 13 RLD for 13 Oxytorp in the Add gear cats box This calculator shows numbers for six gear loadouts Salvos How many salvos For example 1 75 salvos of Bidders * 4 mounts * 3 torpedoes 21 torpedoes total Margin How much time is left over after completing that many salvos Lower margin means less likely to complete that many salvos RLD for next The Final Reload stat needed to complete the next full salvo</p>

<header><h1>Reload Breakpoints</h1></header>
<p>Color shows how much extra RLD from cats and oaths is needed to reach the upper threshold starting from a base of Level 125 Love affinity Gear is assumed to be Snorkel Hull or 10 Oxytorp Hull for Bidder G7e or 10 Oxytorp Snorkel or 10 Oxytorp Oxytorp for Type 95 Kai Percent reload skills are already considered Green 0 Yellow 1 to 20 Orange 21 to 40 Red 41 to max Purple impossible even with max RLD cats 200 affinity and 13 Oxytorps Compare this table to the wiki user page though we excluded Mark 16 because it s irrelevant The most important difference is that our formula is correct discrepancies may occur due to device specific lag while theirs is not For a real example it says Albacore needs 154 RLD for Bidder without Snorkel but our Albacore tested in game with a 10 Oxytorp and single Edelweiss 20 RLD fired the full 24 torpedoes outside of Operation Siren total 126 RLD Don t bother submitting feedback because that author hates us and automatically disparages any proof or work if he suspects it was from us</p>

<header><h1>Simulation</h1></header>
<p>The Subaquatic Secrets Verified SSV Google Sheet contains simulated torpedo counts and hit rates against moving bosses The simulation includes random movement animation trigger time weapon queues and all that stuff Sample videos are linked in the sheet This sheet can provide some context on how important targeting range is The submarine in the top position suffers a lot with Bidder or G7e Barely meeting the minimum reload requirement is almost never good enough</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>Theory</h1></header>
<p>Basic definitions is 2 for G7e and Type 95 Kai or 3 for Bidder is 0 7s for G7e and Type 95 Kai or 0 6s for Bidder Volley fire 1 mount of torpedoes Salvo fire 1 volley from all mounts All max limit broken subs in game currently have 2 torpedo slots x 2 torpedo mounts 4 mounts Submarine Lifecycle After you press the button to summon subs each sub behaves in the following way unless her skills do something special like surface and dive again Spawn at a fixed coordinate off screen and swim to the attacking coordinate which depends on Pressure Resistant Hull the specific sub and the battle field Begin consuming oxygen using skills firing torpedoes and randomly moving within a box centered on her attacking coordinate When oxygen reaches zero the submarine surfaces She can use both torpedoes and guns After seconds have passed she begins retreating She can no longer fire weapons but can finish a volley that began before the retreat There is a delay of 1 weapon cycle or 0 1s between when the sub starts consuming oxygen and when her weapons can first look for targets Thus the total time a sub has to begin volleys is Note Most submarines have an of 5s The exceptions are already included in the calculator s Preset Ships Torpedo Mount Cycle Pretend the submarine only has 1 mount equipped with Bidder This is what the mount does Find valid target in range Begin an animation on the sub s chibi sprite After seconds fires the weapon Repeat times wait seconds then fire 1 torpedo Take to reload the next salvo Reloading a mount takes You can find the on ALDB or wiki for example 21 81s for Bidder We care about the which is the time from the beginning of Step 1 to the end of Step 4 However this is where the game can randomly and inconsistently apply an extra delay The length of the delay is correlated to the device and the sub s but it is not consistent According to our observations trigger duration random trigger delay Bidder volley time G7e T95K volley time 0 067 0 20 3 2 02 1 1 61 7 0 167 0 20 4 2 02 2 1 61 8 0 200 0 30 4 2 12 2 1 71 8 0 333 0 4 2 2 1 8 The game only attempts to find valid targets in range 10 times per second So for one mount the time between beginning a salvo and beginning the next salvo is calculated as Multiple Mounts Now what happens when the submarine has 4 torpedo mounts If all of them are ready to fire the first one fires first While the first one is firing for the others cannot Each mount tracks its own reload progress While the second mount is firing the third and fourth mounts are blocked from firing But the first mount is already on its reload cycle So in the end the multiple mounts do not affect each others salvo times past the first salvo assuming they are all derived from the same equipment But the mount count is indeed important in determining partial salvos The submarine could begin retreating while she s firing her second mount That means she will finish her second mount but not fire her third and fourth mounts in the last salvo In the following example of I 404 with Bidders Snorkel and 162 RLD she begins retreating at time represented by the purple line Notice that the time between the first yellow torpedo line and the thirteenth torpedo is the just over 21s and this also holds between the fourth and sixteenth seventh and nineteenth and so on I 404 Torpedo Time Graph Required Reload Formula Putting it all together we want to calculate the needed to fully complete salvos within the In the following equations we ignore the inequalities and round_to_next_tenth s and we just add RLD one by one at the end until the inequality holds true Behold the final* equation This spits out a reload stat that is lowballed by up to 10 RLD so it may not be the final answer We then need to plug it into the complete salvo formula with the rounding to tenths part and increase the reload one by one until the number of complete salvos ticks up to Reload Equation torpedo_count delay torpedo_count attack_duration total_time total_oxygen 10 attack_duration 0 1 attack_duration trigger_duration torpedo_count delay reload_time reload_time base_weapon_reload_time * 200 100 reload_stat ^0 5 base_weapon_reload_time volley_time
