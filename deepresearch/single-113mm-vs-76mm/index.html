<header><h1>Conclusion</h1></header>
<p>Conclusion first in case you don t want to read First make sure the ship actually wants one of these guns As of May 2025 the most relevant of these ships are Trafalgar Z52 and Kazagumo Other somewhat notable examples include Shimakaze Nana Kawakaze Z47 and Scylla the last of whom can also use Twin 100mm Kai New player or haven t finished the priority gear lab crafts &gt; Blue 76 Don t care about minmaxing &gt; Blue 76 Need survivability and don t have Goldburn &gt; either gun Can afford to put one offensive auxiliary Goldburn or Autoloader can get you to 291 RLD &gt; Gold 113 Not enough RLD &gt; Blue 76 with a different FP aux Bonus You want to pay 120 gold plates for a 2% damage bonus to a single vanguard ship &gt; 13 Gold 113 Note RLD stat is calculated as the white plus green plus yellow number on the ship screen Skill percentage multipliers are applied after but very few ships have that The RLD is 310 in the following example Stat colors</p>

<header><h1>Deep Mechanics</h1></header>
<p>Vanguard guns operate at a frequency of 10 Hertz That is they attempt to fire 10 times per second A gun that reloads in 0 45s and the same gun that reloads in 0 47s are identical in reality because they are both rounded up to 0 50s Meanwhile a gun that reloads in 0 50s is unpredictable because it can go at 0 50s or 0 60s randomly depending on device lag Other factors that affect vanguard firing rate such as animation trigger time are outside the scope of this article From a pure minmaxing perspective the only advantage of the Blue 76 over Gold 113 is its reload time Everything else is worse Hence Blue 76 only has a chance to beat Gold 113 if it crosses a 10 Hertz threshold In most maxed out destroyers cases that threshold is 0 50s In the following tests we explored different reload values on the ship to see whether Blue 76 can beat Gold 113 at certain reload values</p>

<article>
<header><h1>Tests</h1></header>
<p>We tested the two guns using these setups on an oathed Z52 The torpedo was unequipped to reduce variance because her torpedo salvos are irrelevant to the test between the guns and barrages An oathed Z52 with 200 affinity has 245 base RLD and 10 Autoloader takes it to 280 For DD RLD tech values ranging from 0 to 27 our Z52 had 280 to 307 RLD Because Blue 76 reloads faster another option dropping the Autoloader for the All Work All Play Robot was tested Z52 setups We battled Scharnhorst META showdown using this Z52 with various settings of DD RLD tech and both guns Each gun and reload was tested several times with the central Gold 113 threshold of 290 and 291 RLD being tested 10 times each to get a more confident average The main fleet consisted of Vestal and Zuihou for healing without adding damage bias plus Chaser with double ASW planes The other vanguard ships were Jeanne and Eldridge both equipped with anti submarine weapons to reduce variance on Z52 s ASW damage Also note that Scharnhorst META is medium armor and Blue 76 is slightly favored against medium Results Graph</p>

<article>
<header><h1>Analysis</h1></header>
<p>Note Results may vary slightly depending on device lag Gold 113 represented by the red line has a large jump between 290 and 291 RLD At 291 and above it is clearly superior to Blue 76 Below that if Autoloader is required to reach 290 and cannot go above 290 then Blue 76 wins by replacing the Autoloader with a FP auxiliary like All Work All Play Robot Why such a large jump between 290 and 291 RLD Although the game shows 0 50s for both due to rounding that s where Gold 113 goes from 0 5000816527s to 0 4994417526s reload time What a coincidence It s also not completely flat on either side due to the randomness in device lag So 292 is better than 291 and 289 is worse than 290 RLD Reload Times Final note Compared to a torpedo boat like Shimakaze Z52 certainly does have a stronger main gun slot that can benefit from Gold 113 s damage Against light medium and heavy bosses respectively Z52 with 10 Gold 113 has her main gun accounting for 10% 5% and 2% of her total damage respectively We did not calculate Shimakaze but her anti heavy damage is probably less than 1% main gun For torpedo ships the Gold 113 s damage advantage is suppressed leaving nearly only the range and reload difference So there is a possibility that Blue 76 is better for them at more RLD values</p>
