            <p>This is an easy CM that can be very annoying due to various sources of lag and RNG. You must either bring a vanguard heal that activates every 20s, or have carriers that reload slightly faster than 20s for a screen clear. Toolkits alone will not do the job. The best ways to get the heal are</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary Healers (Recommended)<ul>
                    <li>Unicorn, who has the benefit of doing more damage and healing than Perseus. Must be timed properly, 19.92s-19.93s probably works for 5-7 minutes, and 19.94s-19.96s probably works for 10 minutes. For a level 125 Unicorn in love, BF-109G and Ryuusei is 19.95s with 2 RLD tech, or use HVARcat and Ju-87d with 0 RLD tech. Passing the first few stings relies on RNG, because if your vanguard is too close to the boss then they'll get hit before Unicorn heals.</li>
                    <li>Perseus, who suffers from low damage and lower healing. She struggles to keep a sandwiched Aurora alive, so Eldridge is needed. A Plymouth-Aurora-Eldridge vanguard can survive for 7 minutes, which may not be enough time if your main fleet is weak. Furthermore, if her heal lags less than Elbing's sting, then Perseus can cleanse your vanguard of venom right before Scorpion's Mist (which lasts for 2s) expires. If your ships are moving, they regain the venom by touching Scorpion's Mist.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li>Minor Healers (not recommended due to how much damage the boss does)<ul>
                    <li>Little Formidable requires >90% HP, so to avoid her being burnt, bring at least one non-concealed main fleet ship, or pray with a full carrier fleet.</li>
                    <li>Marseillaise for a full-French vanguard.</li>
                    <li>Boise Î¼ with a level 8 healing skill.</li>
                    <li>Ognevoy has a 10s heal, but she desyncs after like 5 minutes due to activating 4x as much as Elbing's skill.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Due to a possible bug, similarly to Cancer (Graf Spee), most vanguard ships get the +60% damage buff permanently, even if they get healed. Ships who gain, lose, or refresh another source of damageRatioBullet, like Bayard or Bremerton, lose the free +60% damage until the next venom mist. Also, damage may be tight so GLHF if you don't have Aurora.</p>

                    <h3 id="mid_bb">Mid-End BB Example</h3>
                    <p>This fleet and gear won in 7:25 using half tech, a random gold/purple submarine fleet with random torps and no synergy, and the free cats level 30 Drake and level 25 Every.</p>

            <!-- </div> -->
            <h3 id="high_bb">High-End BB Examples</h3>
            <p>Any oaths or tech, just keep the faster black-white shell BB blocked behind the slower BB with AFCT/HSFCR. If you use Ognevoy, the fleet has to win faster due to Ognevoy's sync drift and the lack of healing.</p>
            <div class="fleet">

            <h3 id="mid_cv">Mid-End CV Example</h3>
            <p>For the super lazy people who don't want to time Unicorn, you can use Unicorn and Perseus together. This fleet won in 9:49 with no subs, half tech, a single cat without flame, and no HVARcat or Skyraider.</p>
            <a href="imgs/CM/scorpio_midCV.webp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
                <img src="imgs/CM/scorpio_midCV.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Fleet image." width="648" height="667">
            </a>
            
            <h3 id="high_cv">Very High-End CV Example</h3>
            <p>Due to the 1.5s start of battle delay, if your faster CV has exactly 20.0s reload, the screen clear will happen 0.5s after the boss fires the true damage barrage. If your vanguard is too close to the boss due to RNG, then they'll die in that 0.5s. So you want CVs to reload slightly faster than 20s but not too fast that the CVs strike before the barrage appears.</p>
            <p>Or just be a normal person and use the other fleets.</p>

            <h3 id="french">French Example</h3>
            <p>Again, any oaths or tech, just keep the faster black-white shell BBs blocked behind the slower BB with AFCT/HSFCR. Removing Aurora and Plymouth is a big loss in DPS, but the extra BB may recover some of it. Marseillaise is required because she heals French ships every 20s. Elbing does a lot of damage, so Brest is required if your battle will go longer than 5 minutes. The third ship can be Le Mars for fleet buff, Mogador for damage, or L'Audacieux for worse Mogador.</p>
