            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>This is a guide for the monthly constellation extreme challenge mode (CM) in Azur Lane. Each sub-page will have strategies and example fleets. Although we try to be detailed in strategies and provide multiple example fleets, we do not know what ships or gear you have. Treat the example fleets as examples, and consider your own better upgrades or close substitutes.</p>
            <p>We assume Hard (Augur) difficulty, but the same strategies usually work for lower difficulties with worse fleets and gear. We also assume auto battle only, because most of the difficult CM gimmicks are nullified by proper manualing.</p>
            <p>Always check boss stats and skills on <a href="https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/wiki/Extreme_Challenge" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Extreme Challenge</a> wiki (or in game, but sometimes the game says a wrong number).</p>
            
            <h4>Timing</h4>
            <p>Most CM's are exercises in reading and timing. Oaths or exact gear levels (+10 to +13) are not required unless for timing. However, many example fleets are timing-sensitive, and you often won't have the exact ships, oaths, gear, cat RLD, and RLD tech to copy them correctly. Then, you will need to calculate your own fleet timing. To the best of my knowledge, <a href="https://azurlane.mrlar.dev/calculator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this online calculator</a> is the only one that is precise enough for these CM timing calculations. We highly recommend not being scared by it and learning how to use it on desktop.</p>
            <p>If an example fleet requires "50 CV RLD with oath", that means you need oathed CVs and have CV reload from tech + cats = 50. Alternatively, it would also probably work without oaths and with CV tech + cats = 57 or 58.</p>
            <p>Due to how the game code loop works, some boss skills, boss movement patterns, or ship skills can be delayed by 0.0s to 0.1s every time. This is more noticeable in long battles like the game mode this guide is for. Some strategies attempt to account for this delay, but sometimes it can't be fixed.</p>
