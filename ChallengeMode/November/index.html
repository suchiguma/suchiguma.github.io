            <h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>
            <p>This is an easy CM. You must either bring a vanguard heal that activates every 20s, or have carriers that reload slightly faster than 20s for a screen clear. Toolkits alone will not do the job. The easiest ways to get the heal are</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Perseus.</li>
                <li>Bring a timing calculator for Unicorn, who has the benefit of doing more damage than Perseus.</li>
                <li>Little Formidable requires >90% HP, so to avoid her being burnt, bring at least one non-concealed main fleet ship, or pray with a full carrier fleet.</li>
                <li>Marseillaise for a full-French vanguard.</li>
                <li>Boise Î¼ with a level 8 healing skill.</li>
                <li>Ognevoy has a 10s heal, but she desyncs after like 5 minutes due to activating 4x as much as Elbing's skill.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Due to a possible bug, similarly to Cancer (Graf Spee), your vanguard gets the +60% damage buff permanently, even if they get healed. Damage may be tight so GLHF if you don't have Aurora.</p>
            <p>If you use Unicorn, do not make her too fast. The poison remains on the battlefield for 2 seconds, and if your vanguard ships get cleansed and move, they regain the poison.</p>

                    <h3 id="mid_bb">Mid-End BB Example</h3>
                    <p>For a level 125 Unicorn in love, equipping BF-109G and Ryuusei with 3 RLD tech is suitable. Or use HVARcat and Ju-87d with 0 RLD tech. That is 19.92s to 19.96s reload time. This fleet and gear won in 7:25 using half tech, a random gold/purple submarine fleet with random torps and no synergy, and the free cats level 30 Drake and level 25 Every.</p>

            <!-- </div> -->
            <h3 id="high_bb">High-End BB Examples</h3>
            <p>Any oaths or tech, just keep the faster black-white shell BB blocked behind the slower BB with AFCT/HSFCR. Perseus can use any airplanes, and her damage doesn't matter much, but of course HVARcat and Spearfish are the best anti-light. If you use Unicorn, follow the same timing as in Mid-End BB Example. If you use Ognevoy, the fleet has to win faster due to Ognevoy's sync drift.</p>

            </a>
            <h3 id="high_cv">Very High-End CV Example</h3>
            <p>Due to the 1.5s start of battle delay, if your faster CV has exactly 20.0s reload, the screen clear will happen 0.5s after the boss fires the true damage barrage. If your vanguard is too close to the boss due to RNG, then they'll die in that 0.5s. So you want CVs to reload slightly faster than 20s but not too fast that the CVs strike before the barrage appears.</p>
            <p>Or just be a normal person and go slower with Unicorn or Perseus.</p>

            <h3 id="french">French Example</h3>
            <p>Again, any oaths or tech, just keep the faster black-white shell BBs blocked behind the slower BB with AFCT/HSFCR. Removing Aurora and Plymouth is a big loss in DPS, but the extra BB may recover some of it. Marseillaise is required because she heals French ships every 20s. Elbing does a lot of damage, so Brest is required if your battle will go longer than 5 minutes. The third ship can be Le Mars for fleet buff, Mogador for damage, or L'Audacieux for worse Mogador.</p>
