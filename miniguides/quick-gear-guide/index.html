<p>Latest update Added G7e Improved and Su 6 Created by elp this is a collection of simple references to choose the best gear for a gear slot FOR PVE Built with math simulations and tests All comparisons within rows assume maximum enhancement levels but you can still follow this guide with 10 gear As usual the use case or enemy content is separated into two groups Barring PvP all other relevant gamemodes fall under these two categories For example a dual boss is still considered as ST Boss because the same gear works Boss or ST Single target boss battles where we care about pure damage output to one boss Campaign May be further split into mob and boss but campaign boss battles can just be treated as long mob battles Stagger uptime and splash are important factors This is the generalist style of ECTL If you re too lazy to change gear for different bosses then the Mob Campaign gear recommendations can give you the baseline and much worse than optimal performance for specific bosses Disclaimers Warning These tables list the gear that are usually the best Use your own judgment for when certain gear may be optimal in a specific situation like fast HE guns against San Diego CM Most ships in the game will follow this general template but some ships have skills that may change what gear they equip Some of them will be easy to recognize while others will not be if you have questions about whether a ship breaks the mold ask in Discord #gameplay help This is not strictly a crafting guide and as such don t treat all pieces listed in this guide as safe to craft Conversely several pieces of gear have been deliberately omitted from this guide While they might be better than some of the options that are listed though not best in slot they are only marginal improvements over some of the pieces that are listed while being much more expensive to obtain like 13 Monarch Gun For more details consult the ECGC equipment guide It can be overwhelming with its text descriptions separation by gear type and gear that most players shouldn t obtain which is why this Quick Gear Guide tm was created in the first place</p>

<p>Vanguard aux guns should refer to the DD CL guns sections where appropriate DD Guns Some ships strongly prefer the fastest Barrage Spam guns to even the rainbow damage guns against all kinds of enemies and armor types As of December 2025 the most relevant of these ships are Trafalgar Z52 and Kazagumo Other somewhat notable examples include Shimakaze Lenja Nana Kawakaze Z47 and Scylla the last of whom can also use Twin 100mm Kai Minmaxers can read Single 113mm vs 76mm CL Guns CLs who can equip DD guns should refer to the DD Guns section for what gun they should equip CA Guns CB Guns Surface Torpedoes Some ships prefer fast reloading torpedoes to activate skills These include but are not limited to Anchorage Shimanto Vittorio Cuniberti and others Vanguard AA</p>

<header><h1>Submarines</h1></header>
<p>Special note for rainbow sub I 404 prefers G7e Snorkel Hull &gt; Bidder Oxytorp Hull Full rainbow of 95K 95K Oxytorp Oxytorp is even better but expensive The seaplane should always be F8F Bearcat Float It s cheaper and generally safer or more consistent to use both Snorkel and Hull Some subs strongly or weakly prefer an Oxytorp over one of them For example U 101 should definitely not use Hull and most gold USS subs prefer Oxytorp over Snorkel Also Type 95 Kai should not be used with Hull</p>
