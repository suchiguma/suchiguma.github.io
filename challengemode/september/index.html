<header><h1>Manual</h1></header>
<p>This section is for manual only and only months with a notable manual strategy may have a manual section With CVs it is easy just dump airstrikes outside the 10s window of 40% EVA RATE With BBs you probably should still time the DDG missiles but you can supplement the TRP damage by launching manual torpedoes at the right time You can also hold the BB salvos so that they don t hit during the 10s of 40% EVA RATE</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>High-End BB</h1></header>
<p>This is a 2023 strategy who uses UvH these days Bisz is the slowest BB in this example fleet so give her AFCT and the other two will catch up to Bisz after a few salvos Note that Ulrich must be the flagship so that she doesn t grief the whole fleet by firing all the time This setup took 6 to 7 minutes with max tech It starts slow like 20 bars of HP in the first 2 minutes but once the BBs leave the 6s window the boss HP will decrease much faster Calculator link High End BB example fleet</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>Top-End BB</h1></header>
<p>This fleet won in 6 04 with half tech 5 DD RLD tech Every and Drake which are great cats and no submarines DD reload needs to be low enough so that the missiles aren t too fast If they re oathed then try using fewer oxytorps or goldburns Again it starts slow but once the BBs leave the 6s window the boss HP will decrease much faster Calculator link Top End BB example fleet</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>Mid-High End CV</h1></header>
<p>Oaths are exactly as shown and tech plus cats should give 40 to 47 CV RLD to put this fleet in the 20 0s to 20 4s range Took over 9 minutes with half tech and cats This is a rare moment in the Challenge Mode guides where we mixed oaths As always but especially here you will have to calculate your own fleet sync if you can t copy this exactly Hopefully you have better anti light ships to enable the other fleets below Calculator link Mid High End CV example fleet</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>High End CV</h1></header>
<p>Requires 52 to 60 CV RLD if oathed Took 5 minutes but we don t remember whether it was with max tech or half tech Yorkii and Implacable should be tightly synced and 20 0s to 20 4s But as a high end fleet it should win much faster than in 10 minutes so 20 7s may be acceptable too Enterprise is better than a Kearsarge who does 20% main gun damage Put more survivability if youll take longer than 5 minutes Yorkii needs Helena as the third Eagle Union ship Calculator link High End CV example fleet</p>
