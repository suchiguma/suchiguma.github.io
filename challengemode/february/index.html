<p>Read the boss skills and stats on wiki Read the common introduction and disclaimers Timing precision Hard for CVs Medium for BBs DPS check Hard Tank check Medium This month is a difficult vanguard DPS check The Jug has 120k HP 100 EVA 0 LUCK and 300 AA So your vanguard needs to do 2400 damage per second with a 1 5s starting grace period to do the first 2400 damage whenever the Jug spawns This is quite difficult because you can t rely on torpedos barrages and long reload CA guns to do damage consistently the game calls it Recurring damage so we will too Another pain point is when Newcastle goes in front of the Jug to eat up your vanguard s non piercing shells or when Newcastle is above or below the Jug and gets targeted Plymouth gun and Mogador gun are highly recommended but other older AP DD CL guns are weaker by a lot and not worth using over good HE guns Some main fleet ships with 10s attacks or long range aux guns can also help add recurring damage Examples include Ulrich Fritz Saratoga or Rupprecht Submarines or Tempesta IXs can also help for 40s to 60s Warning If your vanguard can t do enough DPS then don t use low damage de buffers like Aurora Sirius or Helena But vanguard DPS isn t the whole story Killing the Jug only gives a 6s window for your main fleet to do full damage to Newcastle so your main fleet also needs to be synced Unfortunately for CVs which require rockets to be good against light armor having three tightly synced CVs means that some rockets will kill the Jug some more rockets will hit the water where the Jug was and only a few rockets will target Newcastle after the Jug dies Hence despite the enemy s low AA of 300 CVs are difficult to use CVs are still better than BBs here if used well with high investment but that will not be the main focus of this guide</p>

<header><h1>Mid-End BB</h1></header>
<p>This is a difficult month so the the fleet should be stronger than the usual mid This fleet has semi high vanguard DPS But because Plymouth s gun is the only piercing weapon Ulrich may or may not be needed to help do recurring damage to the Jug Block Soyuz behind Vanguard but note that giving Soyuz a Mk7 and Vanguard a Mk6 would not be ideal for sync so give them the same gun Also Ulrich needs to avoid the Mk6 Mk7 reload speed so that she doesn t permanently block Soyuz Mid End BB example fleet</p>

<article>
<header><h1>High-End BB</h1></header>
<p>Bismarck Zwei is highly recommended for more than one reason but it is still brute force able with other rainbow BBs This fleet and similar fleets should work with any BB RLD or oaths We mention this every month block the faster BBs behind the slower BB with unequal AFCT HSFCR usage But this month Biszwei should go first to pull the Jug and Newcastle together so we give Soyuz an autoloader to make her reload faster than Biszwei Because these rainbow BBs don t contribute recurring damage besides Bisz s Geryon every other salvo the vanguard absolutely needs to have high DPS Bisz is flag to get Plymouth s buff because Bisz does the most damage by far Z52 s debuff only applies when the above flag BB fires so Bisz s first volley of each salvo won t get it But it s a minor loss and Plymouth and Z52 are both still worth using High End BB example fleet</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>High-End CV</h1></header>
<p>Wait 2 BB 1 CV counts as a CV fleet Too bad take it or leave it There aren t enough high damage carriers who can stagger to make a real strategy for CVs The firing order is Bisz then Soyuz then Nakhimov Bisz and Nakhimov should have the same reload time only Bisz has 15% first load time The BBs kill the Jug then Nakhimov s rockets target Newcastle Soyuz should fire after Bisz so that she can hit both targets and so that her slow persists until Nakhimov s payload hits If Soyuz s barrage activates too early then Nakhimov may not get her 40% crit damage That s why Soyuz in this example has an autoloader that s higher than 0 but not too high Bisz is once again ideal Another UR BB can work but if she and Soyuz fail to kill the Jug then Nakhimov s airstrike is wasted Bisz allows Nakhimov to splash both the Jug and Newcastle with high probability even if the Jug is still alive calculator link High End Hybrid example fleet This video is an alternate version from 2023 Bisz pulls the Jug and Newcastle together and Yorkii rockets them Kearsarge does her own thing because she s really slow</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>Brute Force CV</h1></header>
<p>Not much strategy just have high tech gear cats Enterprise can be faster or slower than Yorkii doesn t really matter But I would guess that Enterprise being faster is better in this case so that her rockets don t hit the water every time There is a lot of lost potential because you kill the Jug at random times and whether another main fleet ship attacks Newcastle in the next 6s is up to chance Fritz is an upgrade over Enterprise Fritz contributes recurring damage and does a lot more damage than a 70% Enterprise Just make sure to give Fritz and Yorkii slightly different reload times with a difference of at least 0 25s say Brute Force CV example fleet</p>
