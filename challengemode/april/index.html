<header><h1>Soyuz BB</h1></header>
<p>Ships don t start reloading until 1 5s into the battle which is still before the boss spawns This delay means that a Sovetsky Soyuz with exactly 20s reload time will finish reloading 1 5s after the lifebuoys spawn However this is acceptable because Soyuz s barrage insta kills the lifebuoys in the remaining 0 3s window before the lifebuoys start healing Remember that Soyuz has a reload bonus when with at least one other battleship We said exactly 20s but 19 95s to 19 97s would be more ideal for safety from lag or poor RNG You can even make Soyuz go as fast as 19 90s if you expect to win in under 5 minutes It is crucial for your other BBs to not interfere with Soyuz s reload They must have AFCT HSFCR and be at least as fast as 20s or they must be slower than Soyuz and also not take AFCT HSFCR Yukikaze s movement cycle puts her in the middle before she summons the lifebuoys However after a few minutes her movement cycle drifts far enough so that she will summon the lifebuoys before reaching the center When Yukikaze does not return to the center in time Soyuz s barrage will miss one or two lifebuoys because the barrage is aimed at Yukikaze There is no way to sync Soyuz to both Yukikaze s movement and to the lifebuoy spawn times Hence you need to finish the battle quick enough or get lucky when Soyuz begins failing to insta kill the lifebuoys Under construction</p>

<header><h1>Soyuz CV</h1></header>
<p>Please read all of the Soyuz BB section first The only differences are that Soyuz does not have a reload bonus with carriers and that carriers can not significantly interfere with Soyuz s reload so it is even okay for them to be 20s and slightly faster or slightly slower than Soyuz If you use Nakhimov she will need to be around 20s to sync with Soyuz Other carriers are more free in timing but making them 20s too is still a good idea to take advantage of Soyuz s slow and small debuff Under construction</p>

<header><h1>High-End BB</h1></header>
<p>Due to the 1 5s start of battle delay in reloading battleships with 20s reload and without AFCT HSFCR fire too late to land more than the first volley of the first battleship Without Soyuz an unreliable way is if your battleships reload faster than 20s then it could work for a few minutes until they fire too long before the lifebuoys spawn So it is better for non Soyuz BB fleets to have one 20s BB with AFCT and two BBs that reload between 18 8s and 19 9s without AFCT Blocking the faster BBs behind the slowest BB is also good for long sync You will still need some luck for the BBs to randomly splash all the lifebuoys Sometimes one may survive for a second but you can outdamage its healing Sometimes you may get unlucky with a lifebuoy surviving for many seconds At that moment regret not having Soyuz Under construction</p>
