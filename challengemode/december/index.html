<p>First read the boss skills if you haven t You must consistently interrupt Warspite every 20s and not mentioned is that her charge attack has 30k HP and finishes in 5s Let success denote your fleet successfully interrupting Warspite by dealing enough damage Let failure denote the opposite Generally a success causes your main fleet to lose a little HP and a failure causes it to lose a LOT of HP Do not expect to tank two or more failures On average the charge attack happens every 20 05s and Warspite stops for 8 2s shown in the chart below every 20 45s Strategies that attempt to take advantage of her stop should consider that timing attacks to her charge attack will become desynced with her stop later in the battle One recurring strategy you will find in the following fleets is a BB excluding Alsace or Unzen with 20s reload time After one failure Warspite will blind your fleet preventing torpedos airstrikes and main fleet salvos from launching The blindness ends around the same time Warspite begins the next charge Since BBs and Unzen cannot begin reloading the next attack while holding one they will become synced with Warspite s charging for the rest of the battle Time graph for skills</p>

<article>
<header><h1>Mid-End</h1></header>
<p>Unfortunately this CM is hard Try your best to copy one of the High End fleets with Helena and manual for clearing barrages or hitting stop times if you need to</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>YOLO: High-End BB</h1></header>
<p>The least effort strategy that may randomly lose even when geared well The BBs have no sync whatsoever so they fire at arbitrary times with UvH offering frequent salvos Every 20s pray that at least one BB s salvo partially falls within the 5s charge attack window and some high DPS vanguard ships can also help reach the 30k threshold The fleet is expected to get a few interrupt failures so you should also pray that your BBs evade enough shells In fleets with non concealed ship s Warspite will fire additional AP barrages at your main fleet ships especially Musashi or the flagship These barrages chip away your BBs HP so it is a DPS race If you don t have three good vanguard ships like Eldridge Aegir Plymouth Unzen Hindenburg Guam or Helena then you could try putting a ship with Flank Defense or Flagship Cover If you put in more effort you can try to get Unzen s torpedos or one of the BBs to have around 20s reload time Then the fleet will win more consistently High End BB example fleet</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>High-End CV</h1></header>
<p>Because carriers except Impero can store airstrikes being blinded once by Warspite will not sync the 20s carriers to the charge attack Therefore these fleets must rely on the vanguard to deal 30k damage in 5s If you can get the vanguard damage to work then 20s CVs with Helena should produce the fastest possible clear times Warning Unzen s 20 0s to 20 1s improved quad mag torpedos are basically required Shown here is an unoathed Unzen with 10 CA RLD tech and a 4 Autoloader yielding a faster reload than 20 0s but Unzen can be lagged or blocked so 19 98s is suitable Ideally you should find a sync with one or two oxytorps instead of autoloader The example could have put two oxytorps but the autoloader toolkit was chosen for people who win slower Shinano being the slowest of the three carriers takes defensive auxes to survive for over 5 minutes High End CV example fleet This is a 2023 video using Hakuryuu instead of Amagi CV but the idea is identical An alternate version with Admiral Nakhimov but requries very high CV RLD and damage Since there is no other Northern Parliament slow we need Royal Fortune to provide slow as well Because of the high CV reload tech after Royal Fortune leaves the CVs have caught up to Warspite s stop times</p>
