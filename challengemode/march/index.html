<header><h1>Strategy</h1></header>
<p>Heavy armor HP piatas Have fun you get a break until next month s hell You don t even need to read these bosses skills As is usually the case with multi boss battles Bismarck Zwei is the best But this month s CM is still easy without her If you defeat King George V in 7 minutes that leaves 3 minutes which should be enough for Duke of York even if she starts the 3 minutes at full HP Note This month can share the same brute force fleets as June so look there if you hope for slightly different options to copy</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>Manual</h1></header>
<p>This section is for manual only and only months with a notable manual strategy may have a manual section Use your vanguard to ram one boss to slow her down Keep ramming until the two bosses are stacked together Your main fleet s DPS will be greatly increased due to splash yes all kinds of torpedoes do have small splash Do not bring single target slows like Eldridge or Aegir because they can separate the bosses</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>Mid-End CV</h1></header>
<p>With half tech mid cats and no submarines this fleet went to 10 minutes and Duke had 10% HP left Ark Royal s 60% slow is not reliable because the bosses move in a circle constantly Perhaps replacing Ibuki with Helena and adding some more 13 airplanes would win Mid End CV example fleet</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>High-End CV</h1></header>
<p>This fleet won in 5 45 with mid cats and no submarines It s a standard single target anti heavy boss fleet with such high DPS that it doesn t matter if the fleet can only damage one boss with each airstrike or if the fleet damages alternating bosses every airstrike Because the reload times are so close together to ensure the correct airstrike order of Amagi CV Implacable then Shinano the flagship is Amagi despite her distance skill preferring off flag High End CV example fleet</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>Advanced CV</h1></header>
<p>This fleet won in 4 25 with mid cats and no submarines Bismarck Zwei pulls the bosses together and CV torpedoes can often splash both bosses The timing is very strict For an unoathed main fleet this works with 54 CV RLD and 0 BB RLD For oathed it s 58 CV and 0 BB If you re missing 2 or 3 CV RLD swap Bishamaru to the staff cat position although this will separate Shinano and Amagi a bit more See June Advanced CV for calculator links For even more damage adjust Unzen s torpedo reload time to be the same as the main fleet s reload time Then she would both hit more and splash two bosses more Advanced CV example fleet</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>Mid-End BB</h1></header>
<p>This fleet won in 8 39 with mid cats and no submarines If you don t have Bismarck Zwei Lala is highly important as the replacement Because BBs are unfavored against heavy bosses you probably won t have enough DPS with SR or weaker UR BBs So this is actually more like high end ships with mid end gear Mid End BB example fleet</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>High-End BB</h1></header>
<p>This fleet won in 5 35 with mid cats and no submarines Bismarck Zwei pulls the bosses together then Musashi and Soyuz can salvo in either order We avoided giving Soyuz a highly enhanced autoloader because that would make her iceberg barrage proc right after Bismarck fires before the bosses have been pulled together High End BB example fleet</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>WTF CV</h1></header>
<p>We do not expect you to copy this It has a low success rate and multiple restarts may be needed to make it faster than Advanced CV There s no black hole or vacuum in sight Instead the fleet relies on Royal Fortune to stack the bosses together However slowing one boss by 40% for 6s causes the other boss to overtake the slowed boss Royal Fortune s slow needs to be combined with a freeze like Implacable s or Nakhimov s at the exact right time Royal Fortune slows one boss Implacable slows and then freezes when the two bosses are stacked together and then Royal Fortune s slow wears off This strategy can fail in multiple ways Even with frame perfect timing RNG can cause the bosses to not be stacked well enough for torpedoes to splash them both Or the vanguard may ram the bosses and cause them to separate slightly Furthermore Royal Fortune does her slowing barrage a few more times before leaving the battle If the barrage hits one boss and misses the other due to evasion then the bosses will also separate Non example fleet</p>
