<p>Added Massachusetts Fubuki York Kln and Rossiya augments on March 12 2025 The cores and experience stones needed to craft and upgrade unique augments are time gated Currently it is impossible to have crafted and maxed all unique augments released in the game Meta chasing and new players need to choose carefully which ships to craft augments for Thus this augment module tier list was made to rate the effectiveness and worth of each augment to help you make those decisions Read the Augmentation wiki page for how to get upgrade and use augments Expand to see the rubric. Gain Gain for unique augments rates the overall benefit the augment brings to the ship over a generic purple augment (or no augment, for ships who can't use purple augments). This includes damage, survivability, buffing, and everything. The relative strength of the ship does not matter; a +50% damage boost for a weak ship should be rated the same as a +50% damage boost for a strong ship. Worth Worth is subjective. If you must use a waifu no matter what, then of course her augment would be very much worth. So the &quot;worth&quot; ratings in the table roughly follows this rubric: Has sizeable gain for a ship who sees various endgame use. Has sizeable gain for a ship who is good in at least some endgame content and has few other substitutes. Makes the ship useful for midgame to lategame. Makes the ship decent but not meta. Worse than or equal to purple augments, or the augmented ship would still be bad. New SKK Rates &quot;worth&quot; for new players, covering your first two or three unique augments or until you reach &quot;midgame&quot; (farming Chapter 12 or beating Abyssal zones). Obviously, do not craft the unique augment of a ship you don't own.... This tier list should not force you to obtain a ship. The most important in helping a new player reach midgame. Very helpful for a new player to reach midgame. Good to have as a new player but maybe a bit out of order. Diverts resources away from far more important augments or outlives its usefulness quickly. Simply a waste of augment resources for a new player. Collabs Collab augments are cheaper to max level, and this cheapness is included in both &quot;worth&quot; ratings for all players and for new players. If an old collab augment is said to be worth for new players, obviously new new players can't get them (or the ships) anymore. So it is just there for new players who got the ship and augment, then quit the game and recently returned.</p>
