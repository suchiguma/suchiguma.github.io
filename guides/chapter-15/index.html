<p>This guide is for first time clearing Chapter 15 on auto in lethal threat level with manual enemy node selection Auto search on safe threat for farming Houston II is not covered maybe just take 15 4 Option A and add a healer to the boss fleet If you have reached Chapter 15 we assume you know basic fleet building fleet positioning and basic game terminology like BB AA and ASW Read wiki notes for mechanics Read the Allied Support Carriers point very carefully A message about requirements 15 1 and 15 2 Same as in Chapter 14 X 1 and X 2 form the tutorial and X 3 and X 4 are much harder The enemy order here is six mobs one boss The 15 1 boss has medium armor and the 15 2 boss has heavy armor Both your mob and boss fleets need to contain decent ships and gear There is nothing notable about 15 1 as its a tutorial to Chapter 15 The boss in 15 2 is a double BBV boss Ise and Hyuuga Their shelling can delete a full HP main fleet ship in the span of three seconds Putting a washing machine and EVA augment Scepter or Officer s Sword on your main fleet ships especially the flagship is strongly recommended for 15 2 only Be prepared to quit the battle and retry Summon submarines just before the bosses spawn so they can help delete the bosses quicker If you choose to manual use airstrikes to cancel the bosses salvos 15 3 Enemy submarines appear in Reconnaissance Fleets DD nodes in 15 3 and 15 4 Your mob fleet must bring ASW Technically you could fight BB nodes and CV nodes only but thats certainly harder The enemy order in 15 3 is three mobs medium armor first boss two mobs medium armor second boss The same boss fleet you used for 15 1 and 15 2 should be able to handle the second boss But now your mob fleet has to deal with submarines and a tough first boss Strongly consider shifting some better gear and or ships to the mob fleet if your boss fleet is not struggling 15 4 The enemy order in 15 4 is three mobs medium armor first boss two mobs light armor second boss one mob light medium armor third boss All Options You can use either your mob fleet or your boss fleet to fight each of the three bosses So there are 2^3 8 ways to assign your fleets to the bosses This bar chart approximates how strong your mob and boss fleets need to be for six of eight ways The leftmost four orders are recommended while the rightmost two are not The chart and recommendations assume that Clearing Mode is OFF so the Data Analyzed debuff will apply and MMM and BBB are excluded for obvious reasons Option A A very strong boss fleet fights the first and third bosses BMB Try to not spend more than 25% of any ships HP in the first boss battle Using a healer with good damage like Volga is reasonable but damage is still important The mob fleet can be about as strong as the 15 3 mob fleet You have access to an ammo node and the second boss is a pushover and acts as free healing if you are using two healers The only harder parts compared to 15 3 are that enemies are one level higher and that there are two Special Aviation Fleets Option B A very strong mob fleet fights all mobs first boss and third boss MBM Since the boss fleet is only dealing with an easy second boss you can add crossfleet ships to help the mob fleet The boss fleet can look like UR BB Independence Perseus tank flex flex Option B third star Option B is also the most consistent strategy to defeat all mobs to get the third star on lethal threat level To get the third star we recommend this order Do NOT use the ammo node early Fight two Special Aviation Fleets Fight one more enemy We want to prioritize Large Main Fleets while the mob fleet still has ammo If there are none choose a Large Air Formation or whatever is hardest Fight Boss 1 and then one more enemy following the same order as in Step 2 Now the mob fleet is out of ammo Choose a hard enemy if your fleet is healthy otherwise choose an easy enemy Use the boss fleet for Boss 2 Reserve two Medium or Large Reconnaissance fleets and Boss 3 until the end Use your mob fleet to fight everything else Pick up the full 3 ammo node clear the last two Reconnaissance fleets to hopefully heal up and clear Boss 3 Recommendation If you can t three star on lethal then don t Safe threat level gives your fleet like 20% damage dealt and 36% damage taken</p>

<p>Mob Boss Fleet Mob fleet UR BB 2 healer CV CVLs tank flex flex Boss fleet UR BB 2 damage CV CVLs tank flex flex The flex slots should not be squishy and should contribute survivability AA and or damage Add ASW in the 15 3 15 4 mob fleet Good ships can contribute two or three or even four of these You can bring a single healer like Unicorn for the mob fleet but it adds inconsistency and makes recovering from suicide boat leaks or submarine leaks extremely difficult Solo healer is great when your fleet is very strong but if you have a great fleet and account then you re winning with or without a second healer anyways For the boss fleet damage carriers you may use a semi preload like Independence or Impero to deal with the pre boss waves quicker These two also have strong damage for the boss anyways If you use two normal reload carriers then try to desync them Support Carrier Fleet Carrier level AVI and RLD matter Affinity affects AVI and RLD You should get all support carriers to at least level 120 and Love affinity because Chapter 15 is not the place to be cutting corners at The equipped fighter and the fighter enhancement level matter The DB or TB can be any enhancement level and any plane just have gold or rainbow for 45 or 65 avi stat Assuming all have equal level affinity and gear etc the best support fleet carriers are in slightly decreasing order of strength Fritz Rumey much stronger Hwah Jah Retrofit Nakhimov REQUIRES DEV 30 Indomitable Implacable Illustrious Illustrious  Chen Hai Retrofit Little Illustrious Langley Retrofit Yorktown II Independence Albion Centaur Slightly means slightly it s ok to use a more accessible ship lower on the list The best support fighter is expected to be the new FW 190 G 3 R1 by a significant margin pending testing It also happens to be quite cheap to craft in Gear Lab for a gold gear The next bests are Flapjack and Hellcat followed by Skyrocket Me 155A and fw190a5 If you are on a budget prioritize Flapjacks for the surface fleets Fill the support fleet with your available gold Hellcats and Me 155A s then craft from gear lab Skyrocket or fw190a5 for the remaining slots Submarine Fleet They are all similar pick any three SR subs Many bonus points for high oxygen some bonus points for fleet synergy Use Improved Snorkel on everyone Use any mix of Bidder G7e or Type 95 Kai or use six of the same it doesnt matter Example submarine setup Example submarine setup Submarines should be used on all boss battles but optional for 15 4s second boss so reserve ammo for those Spend the other ammo on out of ammo battles or the Special Aviation Fleet Avoid summoning submarines at the beginning of a battle Summoning submarines early in battle means that they surface and die Summon them 20 to 40 seconds into the battle so that you win before they run out of oxygen You know roughly how long your battles take</p>

<header><h1>Gear Notes</h1></header>
<p>If you havent been playing Operation Siren you probably wont win in Chapter 15 Lots of the best gear is in Gear Lab and 13 gear is a huge boost in strength Bring Hedgehog and at least one other ASW weapon on the mob fleet for 15 3 and 15 4 Options include a gold ASW plane or purple ASW plane on a CVL a purple depth charge or Eldridge Retrofit Mob fleet BB wants 457mm Twin 410 kai for Musashi Boss fleet BB can use another 457mm or a 20s triple gun like champ gun For BB aux guns Quad 152 &gt; 137mm &gt; Triple 155mm Felix gun gold Twin 150 &gt; Triple 155mm Kai Mob and boss fleet fighters Flapjack &gt; Tigercat corsair pirate squad Torpedo bombers Wyvern &gt; Spearfish &gt; Breguet &gt; poverty AA guns STAAG for main fleet Sextuple for the strongest AA gun slot some mix of Twin 57mm Twin 90mm Sextuple or Twin 113mm for the rest Obviously the more rainbow 57mm the better Auxes standard auxes but vanguard ships especially if the middle slot is not a DD can use anti torpedo bulges if they are not occupied with ASW</p>

<header><h1>Misc. Recommendations</h1></header>
<p>Use cats they do not have to be perfect Random level 30 cats boost your fleet by 10 20% Important talents mountain on mob flame when out of ammo &gt; flame when with ammo mountain on boss &gt; other stuff Use double line or circular formation never single line depending on how good your fleets AA is Kill the enemy Special Aviation Fleet at the beginning of each sortie Avoid Large Medium Main Fleets If you re 3 starring use Shimanto and or Musashi and never fight them when out of ammo Check the tier list on the home page for what ships are good and sort by Chapter 15 Mob Boss Or this Chapter 15 specific tier list for a quick overview of ships by role but it s not updated since November 2024</p>

<header><h1>Example Fleets</h1></header>
<p>The part you ve been waiting for or skipped to Please don t complain if you copy these and lose because you didn t read the above instructions or don t know how to choose better gear or ships https renhex github io alft 253 typical fleets for 15 1 15 3 or 15 4 Option A Add your better gear or ships Add washing machines for 15 2 https renhex github io alft 254 a top mob fleet for 15 4 Option B Do not use such a weak boss fleet on other maps Also can act as 3 starring fleets that may or may not work on lethal depending on whether your account is actually good Yes there are better newer ships that let you win even harder We won t update this fleet every month Tip Fleet screenshots using Azur Lane Fleet Tool show the vanguard from bottom main tank to top off tank It s like the in game Formation screen but rotated counter clockwise The ships are also marked with 1 2 and 3 from bottom to top Correct vanguard order</p>
