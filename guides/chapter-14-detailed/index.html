<p>Note Example fleets are one page up at Chapter 14 Brief If you have reached Chapter 14 we assume you know basic fleet building fleet positioning and basic game terminology like BB CV ASW and concealment Read wiki notes for mechanics introduced by Chapter 14 You can skip it and just follow or copy this guide but if things go wrong then it would be helpful to know why they went wrong Please know what concealment and detection mean at least for the main fleet</p>

<header><h1>Threats</h1></header>
<p>Now let s discuss the four main threats in Chapter 14 first These are BBs airplanes suicide boats and submarines Enemy BBs Chapter 14 isn t the first place where enemy BBs can deal significant damage to your main fleet What is new is that there can be three or even four enemy BBs on screen at once Also your own BB is now concealed which means enemies can blind fire your squishy CV L instead of focusing on your tanky BB An enemy mass produced BB blind fires Painlev Blind fire occurs when your whole main fleet is concealed In this image the production type BB fired two volleys of two HE shells at Painlev If they hit HE shells do some damage and have a chance to set a fire for a lot more damage Burning causes your ship s detection gauge to increase If revealed the ship will be focus fired by all enemy BBs for massive damage Your top main fleet ship seems to be more likely to receive shelling than your bottom main fleet ship It may be because more enemy BBs spawn in the top lane BBs in the top lane stay alive for longer or both Put your more fragile carrier in the bottom Do not use Bowguns or Hunting Bows because EVA stat is better Minimize enemy BBs opportunities to do damage by staggering your main fleet attacks and clearing enemy waves quickly Airplanes There are much fewer airplanes than in Chapter 13 Thus the airplanes can t do much damage to your main fleet or can they As mentioned in the wiki section about detection whenever an airplane reaches your main fleet all of your main fleets detection gauges increase And if a ship gets revealed through some combination of fires and airplanes then she will be targeted by all BBs Yamashiro launches 4 or 5 airplanes The key to killing sparse squadrons of airplanes consistently is range because airplanes usually need to be hit twice to die In the image the enemy Yamashiro launches planes directly into the player s high AA gun range and the airplanes will get hit a second time with high probability High range also applies to airplanes that come from the right of the screen it decreases the probability of airplane leaks due to your vanguard s random movement Suicide Boats There are two types of suicide boats in Chapter 14 the usual fast Bombing Ship with about 900 HP and the Kagerou Production unique to Chapter 14 Each Kagerou Production has over 9 000 HP okay over 10 000 and a frontal shield that can block 32 shells from your vanguard guns or BB auxiliary guns A Kagerou Production If any suicide boat survives it deals high damage and increases your main fleet s detection gauge If you ve been reading this guide in order then you know why that is significant Thanks to the shield most fleets won t be able to kill Kagerou Productions purely with vanguard guns and BB aux guns while having ammo let alone when out of ammo So you will need help from other damage sources like bombs BB shells torpedoes and skill barrages Tip Stagger your main fleet attacks and vanguard torpedoes both to clear enemy waves quickly and to randomly hit Kagerou Productions There are too many variables at play here to test which CL or DD gun is the best for BBs And nowadays Chapter 14 is not difficult or interesting enough to encourage someone to spend hours on testing Hence we prepared the following list based on logic and various players observations Neptune gun completely flunks the prerequisite of high shell count Plymouth gun only fires 4 shells and doesn t have great damage so it s probably not good despite being able to pierce and being rainbow Triple 155mm and its Eagle Union counterpart fire 6 shells and do high damage against light armor but their fixed spread patterns may not be ideal Triple 155mm Kai and Twin 137mm are the usual recommendations because they fire 6 shells and have reasonable chances to hit Triple 155mm Kai does more damage per shell while Twin 137mm has zero spread and can pierce Pierce is nice because sometimes a Bombing Ship hides behind a Kagerou Production Recommended BB auxiliary guns Submarines Enemy submarines only appear in 14 3 and 14 4 and they appear only in Reconnaissance Fleets a k a DD nodes Due to their concealment submarines often can dodge some depth charges You should bring more ASW in your mob fleet than a single Hedgehog and the default depth charges Options include the purple Improved Depth Charge the ASW airplanes like Gannet and Eldridge Retrofit Leaked submarines deal high damage and for the fourth time in this guide increases your main fleet s detection gauge</p>

<header><h1>General Tips</h1></header>
<p>There are lots of enemy torpedoes so the Anti Torpedo Bulge can help cruisers Capturing the lighthouse as early as possible is a good idea for most fleets However players have reported mixed results with flares Theoretically flares can help wipe out the enemy Kagerou Productions and elite chibis if your main fleet attack is timed with the flare However flares come with several downsides Lighthouses have the same downsides but they are less impactful Your main fleet ships tend to target enemies revealed by flares which are usually Kagerou Productions or an elite chibi DD CL CA This focus can leave the dangerous production BBs in the back alive for longer Flaring an enemy does not permanently reveal it Instead the enemy s concealment is temporarily set to 0 After the flare expires or the enemy exits the flare s range the enemy s concealment instantly returns to its previous value That makes the enemy stay concealed for longer and is a loss for you if you don t manage to deal significant damage during the flare Contrary to popular belief propagated by the outdated ECTL guide spamming the enemy with pellets does not reduce their concealment They acknowledged their error in 2022 and have yet to fix it as of 2025 Read Concealment mechanics for the correct details about how enemy concealment decays although it shouldn t affect fleet building by much</p>

<header><h1>Map Walkthrough</h1></header>
<p>14 1 and 14 2 14 1 is the tutorial of the chapter Put your knowledge of Threats and General Tips to good use or copy the example fleets 14 2 has a much more dangerous boss battle than 14 1 does despite both bosses being BBVs with similar stats The reason is that 14 1 s boss phase starts with one production BB and only an AA ship and a Bombing Ship respawn regularly 14 2 s boss phase has two production BBs that respawn regularly along with an AA ship two Bombing Ships and a Kagerou Production They slap both your top and bottom main fleet ships and act as more targets and HP you need to deal with 14 3 and 14 4 Enemy submarines appear in Reconnaissance Fleets DD nodes in 14 3 and 14 4 Your mob fleet must bring ASW Technically you could fight BB nodes only but thats harder The bosses in 14 3 are two light armor DDs and the respawning reinforcements include only one production BB one AA ship one CA and two Bombing Ships You might find this easier to deal with than the 14 2 boss Do not be tempted to use HVAR Hellcat or Skyraider for anti light You will grief your ability to deal with the pre boss waves which contain a lot of heavy armor as well as the production BBs in the boss wave Similarly avoid BF 109G or La 9 against any Chapter 14 enemy the most you might want to risk is a single rocket fighter in a smaller airplane slot Rockets also deal with concealed enemies poorly 14 4 has seven mob battles but there is an ammo node available The boss battle has four waves of enemies before the boss spawns three of which contain BBs In the boss wave regular reinforcements include two production BBs two AA ships and three Bombing Ships The whole boss battle is very long and punishing</p>

<header><h1>Misc. Recommendations</h1></header>
<p>Recommendation If you can t three star on lethal then don t Safe threat level gives your fleet like 20% damage dealt and 36% damage taken Use cats they do not have to be perfect Random level 30 cats boost your fleet by 10 20% and perfect cats boost even more Important talents Mountain on mob Flame when out of ammo &gt; Flame when with ammo Mountain on boss &gt; other stuff Quit and retry a battle if you get unlucky Maybe your main fleet got burnt or revealed too early or your vanguard ate too many torpedoes Check the tier list on the home page for what ships are good and sort by Chapter 14 Mob Boss</p>
