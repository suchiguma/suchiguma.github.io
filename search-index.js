Story","A long long time ago but after EN servers beta period I was a clueless little new player I found some deteriorating and in hindsight often questionable guides on the street and perused them diligently along with the EN wiki helping me clear Chapter 12 with ease However as a casual player I fell victim to mistakes such as retiring ships after level 70 MLB for the noble but misguided ideal of clearing dock space some of the ships lost in the great purges offered key level 120 tech stats sorry Intrepid and Eskimo Sometime in late 2020 I began taking the game more seriously I farmed 12 2 and 12 4 with a 1 3 fleet and even wrote a simulation to calculate when to retreat from 12 4 for maximum ship experience gains this was before clearing rewards were added for completing the boss battle However mobilizing my account to handle the endgame content of the time proved slow and I failed to one shot Hiryuu META and Ark Royal META when Operation Siren released Fast forward a few years and it seems I ve made rather respectable progress despite my dubious beginnings Today Im hailed as one of the most eminent scholars of my field My journey proves that I I forgot the point of writing this story",""],["home@@contact@@","Home","Contact","","I hang out in the Azur Lane Official Discord If you have a general gameplay question that can be formulated outside the context of this

gear you have Treat the example fleets as examples and consider your own better upgrades or close substitutes Warning Do not treat examples as requirements New Jersey s presence in an example fleet is not an endorsement for using UR bulins on her We assume Hard Augur difficulty but the same strategies usually work for lower difficulties with worse fleets and gear We also assume auto battle only because most of the difficult CM gimmicks are nullified by proper manualing Always check boss stats and skills on Extreme Challenge wiki or in game but sometimes the game says a wrong number Tip Fleet

gear levels 10 to 13 are not required unless for timing However many example fleets are timing sensitive and you often won t have the exact ships oaths gear cat RLD and RLD tech to copy them correctly Then you will need to calculate your own fleet timing To the best of our knowledge this online calculator henceforth referred to as the calculator is the only one that is precise enough for these CM timing calculations We highly recommend not being scared by it and learning how to use it on desktop If an example fleet requires 50 CV RLD with oath that means you need oathed CVs and have CV reload from tech cats 50 Alternatively it would also probably work without oaths and with CV tech cats 57 or 58 Due to how the game code loop works some boss skills boss movement patterns or ship skills can be delayed by 0 0s to 0 1s every time This is more noticeable in long battles like the game mode this guide is for Some strategies attempt to account for this delay but sometimes it can t be fixed",""],["challengemode@@november@@strategy","Challenge Mode","November Challenge","Strategy","read the wiki Timing precision Hard DPS check Medium Tank check Hard This is a CM that can be very annoying due to various sources of lag and RNG However do not be scared by the double Hard If you time Unicorn precisely then the Tank check is naturally solved Or if you bring tanks and Perseus then Perseus trivializes the timing precision You must either bring a vanguard heal that activates every 20s or have carriers that reload slightly faster than 20s for a screen clear Toolkits alone will not do the job The best ways to get the heal are Primary Healers Recommended Unicorn who has the benefit of doing more damage and healing than Perseus Must be timed properly 19 92s 19 93s probably works for 5 7 minutes and 19 94s 19 96s probably works for 10 minutes For a level 125 Unicorn in love BF 109G and Ryuusei is 19 95s in game with 2 RLD tech also try 3 RLD if 2 doesn t work or use HVARcat and Ju 87d with 0 RLD tech Do not bring cats with CVL RLD Passing the first few stings relies on RNG because if your vanguard is too close to the boss then they ll get hit before Unicorn heals Perseus who suffers from low damage and lower healing She struggles to keep a sandwiched Aurora alive so Eldridge is needed A Plymouth Aurora Eldridge vanguard can survive for 7 minutes which may not be enough time if your main fleet is weak Furthermore if her heal lags less than Elbing s sting then Perseus can cleanse your vanguard of venom right before Scorpion s Mist which lasts for 2s expires If your ships are moving they regain the venom by touching Scorpion s Mist Minor Healers not recommended due to how much damage the boss does Little Formidable requires >90% HP so to avoid her being burnt bring at least one non concealed main fleet ship or pray with a full carrier fleet Marseillaise for a full French vanguard Boise  with a level 8 healing skill Ognevoy has a 10s heal but she desyncs after like 5 minutes due to activating 4x as much as Elbing s skill Due to a possible bug similarly to Cancer Graf Spee most vanguard ships get the 60% damage buff permanently even if they get healed Ships who gain lose or refresh another source of damageRatioBullet like Bayard or Bremerton lose the free 60% damage until the next venom mist Also damage may be tight so GLHF if you don t have

to be slightly faster than 20s which is a high bar for CVs but not CVLs like Unicorn Due to the 1 5s start of battle delay if your faster CV has exactly 20 0s reload the screen clear will happen 0 5s after the boss fires the true damage barrage If your vanguard is too close to the boss due to RNG then they ll die in that 0 5s So you want CVs to reload slightly faster than 20s but not so fast that

Timing precision Medium DPS check Medium Tank check Hard First read the boss skills if you haven t You must consistently interrupt Warspite every 20s and not mentioned is that her charge attack has 30k HP and finishes in 5s Let success denote your fleet successfully interrupting Warspite by dealing enough damage Let failure denote the opposite Generally a success causes your main fleet to lose a little HP and a failure causes it to lose a LOT of HP Do not expect to tank two or more failures On average the charge attack happens every ~20 05s and Warspite stops for ~8 2s shown in the chart below every ~20 45s Strategies that attempt to take advantage of her stop should consider that timing attacks to her charge attack will become desynced with her stop later in the battle One recurring strategy you will find in the following fleets is a BB excluding Alsace or Unzen with 20s reload time After one failure Warspite will blind your fleet preventing torpedos airstrikes and main fleet salvos from launching The blindness ends around the same time Warspite begins the next charge Since BBs and Unzen cannot begin reloading the next attack while holding one they will become synced with Warspite s charging for the rest of the battle Time graph for skills",""],["challengemode@@december@@mid-end","Challenge Mode","December Challenge","Mid-End","Unfortunately this CM is hard Try your

Challenge","YOLO: High-End BB","The least effort strategy that may randomly lose even when geared well The BBs have no sync whatsoever so they fire at arbitrary times with UvH offering frequent salvos Every 20s pray that at least one BB s salvo partially falls within the 5s charge attack window and some high DPS vanguard ships can also help reach the 30k threshold The fleet is expected to get a few interrupt failures so you should also pray that your BBs evade enough shells In fleets with non concealed ship s Warspite will fire additional AP barrages at your main fleet ships especially Musashi or the flagship These barrages chip away your BBs HP so it is a DPS race If you don t have three good vanguard ships like Eldridge Aegir Plymouth Unzen Hindenburg Guam or Helena then you could try putting a ship with Flank Defense or Flagship Cover If you put in more effort you can try to get Unzen s torpedos or one of the BBs to have around 20s reload time Then the fleet will win more consistently High End BB example fleet",""],["challengemode@@december@@high-end-cv","Challenge Mode","December Challenge","High-End CV","Because carriers except Impero can store airstrikes being blinded once by Warspite will not sync the 20s carriers to the charge attack Therefore these fleets must rely on the vanguard to deal 30k damage in 5s If you can get the vanguard damage to work then ~20s CVs with Helena should produce the fastest possible clear times Warning Unzen s 20 0s to 20 1s improved quad mag torpedos are all but required Shown here is an unoathed Unzen with 10 CA RLD tech and a 4 Autoloader yielding a faster reload than 20 0s but Unzen can be lagged or blocked so 19 98s is suitable Ideally you should find a sync with one or two oxytorps instead of autoloader The example could have put two oxytorps but the autoloader toolkit was chosen for people who win slower Shinano being the slowest of the three carriers takes defensive auxes to survive for over 5 minutes High End CV example fleet This is a 2023 video using Hakuryuu instead of Amagi CV but the idea is identical An alternate version with Admiral Nakhimov but requries very high CV RLD and damage Since there is no other Northern Parliament slow we need Royal Fortune to provide slow as well Because of the high CV reload tech after Royal Fortune leaves the CVs have caught up to Warspite s stop
