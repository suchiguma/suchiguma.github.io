      <text>A long long time ago but after EN servers beta period I was a clueless little new player I found some deteriorating and in hindsight often questionable guides on the street and perused them diligently along with the EN wiki helping me clear Chapter 12 with ease However as a casual player I fell victim to mistakes such as retiring ships after level 70 MLB for the noble but misguided ideal of clearing dock space some of the ships lost in the great purges offered key level 120 tech stats sorry Intrepid and Eskimo Sometime in late 2020 I began taking the game more seriously I farmed 12 2 and 12 4 with a 1 3 fleet and even wrote a simulation to calculate when to retreat from 12 4 for maximum ship experience gains this was before clearing rewards were added for completing the boss battle However mobilizing my account to handle the endgame content of the time proved slow and I failed to one shot Hiryuu META and Ark Royal META when Operation Siren released Fast forward a few years and it seems I ve made rather respectable progress despite my dubious beginnings Today Im hailed as one of the most eminent scholars of my field My journey proves that I I forgot the point of writing this story</text>

      <text>This guide is for first time clearing Chapter 15 on auto in lethal threat level with manual enemy node selection Auto search on safe threat for farming Houston II is not covered maybe just take 15 4 Option A and add a healer to the boss fleet If you have reached Chapter 15 we assume you know basic fleet building fleet positioning and basic game terminology like BB AA and ASW Read wiki notes for mechanics Read the Allied Support Carriers point very carefully A message about requirements 15 1 and 15 2 Same as in Chapter 14 X 1 and X 2 form the tutorial and X 3 and X 4 are much harder The enemy order here is six mobs one boss The 15 1 boss has medium armor and the 15 2 boss has heavy armor Both your mob and boss fleets need to contain decent ships and gear There is nothing notable about 15 1 as its a tutorial to Chapter 15 The boss in 15 2 is a double BBV boss Ise and Hyuuga Their shelling can delete a full HP main fleet ship in the span of three seconds Putting a washing machine and EVA augment Scepter or Officer s Sword on your main fleet ships especially the flagship is strongly recommended for 15 2 only Be prepared to quit the battle and retry Summon submarines just before the bosses spawn so they can help delete the bosses quicker If you choose to manual use airstrikes to cancel the bosses salvos 15 3 Enemy submarines appear in Reconnaissance Fleets DD nodes in 15 3 and 15 4 Your mob fleet must bring ASW Technically you could fight BB nodes and CV nodes only but thats just simply harder The enemy order in 15 3 is three mobs medium armor first boss two mobs medium armor second boss The same boss fleet you used for 15 1 and 15 2 should be able to handle the second boss But now your mob fleet has to deal with submarines and a tough first boss Strongly consider shifting some better gear and or ships to the mob fleet if your boss fleet is not struggling 15 4 The enemy order in 15 4 is three mobs medium armor first boss two mobs light armor second boss one mob light medium armor third boss Option A A very strong boss fleet fights the first and third bosses Try to not spend more than 25% of any ships HP in the first boss battle Using a healer with good damage like Volga is reasonable but damage is still important The mob fleet can be about as strong as the 15 3 mob fleet You have access to an ammo node and the second boss is a pushover and acts as free healing if you are using two healers The only harder parts compared to 15 3 are that enemies are one level higher and that there are two Special Aviation Fleets Option B A very strong mob fleet fights all mobs first boss and third boss Tip This very strong mob fleet should contain at least two of Guam Laffey II Eldridge Retrofit San Diego Retrofit and Shimanto Since the boss fleet is only dealing with an easy second boss you can add crossfleet ships to help the mob fleet The boss fleet can look like UR BB Independence Perseus tank flex flex Option B is also the most consistent strategy to defeat all mobs to get the third star Option B third star To get the third star we recommend this order Do NOT use the ammo node early Fight two Special Aviation Fleets Fight one more enemy We want to prioritize Large Main Fleets while the mob fleet still has ammo If there are none choose a Large Air Formation or whatever is hardest Fight Boss 1 and then one more enemy following the same order as in Step 2 Now the mob fleet is out of ammo Choose a hard enemy if your fleet is healthy otherwise choose an easy enemy Use the boss fleet for Boss 2 Reserve two Medium or Large Reconnaissance fleets and Boss 3 until the end Use your mob fleet to fight everything else Pick up the full 3 ammo node clear the last two Reconnaissance fleets to hopefully heal up and clear Boss 3 Recommendation If you can t three star on lethal then don t Safe threat level gives your fleet like 20% damage dealt and 36% damage taken</text>

      <score>STANDARD</score>
      <text>The cores and experience stones needed to craft and upgrade unique augments are time gated Currently it is impossible to have crafted and maxed all unique augments released in the game Meta chasing and new players need to choose carefully which ships to craft augments for Thus this augment module tier list was made to rate the effectiveness and worth of each augment to help you make those decisions Expand to see the rubric. Gain Gain for unique augments rates the overall benefit the augment brings to the ship over a generic purple augment (or no augment, for ships who can't use purple augments). This includes damage, survivability, buffing, and everything. The relative strength of the ship does not matter; a +50% damage boost for a weak ship should be rated the same as a +50% damage boost for a strong ship. Worth Worth is subjective. If you must use a waifu no matter what, then of course her augment would be very much worth. So the "worth" ratings in the table roughly follows this rubric: Has sizeable gain for a ship who sees various endgame use. Has sizeable gain for a ship who is good in at least some endgame content and has few other substitutes. Makes the ship useful for midgame to lategame. Makes the ship decent but not meta. Worse than or equal to purple augments, or the augmented ship would still be bad. New SKK Rates "worth" for new players, covering your first two or three unique augments or until you reach "midgame" (farming Chapter 12 or beating Abyssal zones). Obviously, do not craft the unique augment of a ship you don't own.... This tier list should not force you to obtain a ship. The most important in helping a new player reach midgame. Very helpful for a new player to reach midgame. Good to have as a new player but maybe a bit out of order. Diverts resources away from far more important augments or outlives its usefulness quickly. Simply a waste of augment resources for a new player. Collabs Collab augments are cheaper to max level, and this cheapness is included in both "worth" ratings for all players and for new players. If an old collab augment is said to be worth for new players, obviously new new players can't get them (or the ships) anymore. So it is just there for new players who got the ship and augment, then quit the game and recently returned.</text>

      <text>Most CM s are exercises in reading and timing Oaths or exact gear levels 10 to 13 are not required unless for timing However many example fleets are timing sensitive and you often won t have the exact ships oaths gear cat RLD and RLD tech to copy them correctly Then you will need to calculate your own fleet timing To the best of our knowledge this online calculator henceforth referred to as the calculator is the only one that is precise enough for these CM timing calculations We highly recommend not being scared by it and learning how to use it on desktop If an example fleet requires 50 CV RLD with oath that means you need oathed CVs and have CV reload from tech cats 50 Alternatively it would also probably work without oaths and with CV tech cats 57 or 58 Due to how the game code loop works some boss skills boss movement patterns or ship skills can be delayed by 0 0s to 0 1s every time This is more noticeable in long battles like the game mode this guide is for Some strategies attempt to account for this delay but sometimes it can t be fixed</text>

      <text>Forgo healing and use CV screenclear to wipe the sting barrage This requires carriers to be slightly faster than 20s which is a high bar for CVs but not CVLs like Unicorn Due to the 1 5s start of battle delay if your faster CV has exactly 20 0s reload the screen clear will happen 0 5s after the boss fires the true damage barrage If your vanguard is too close to the boss due to RNG then they ll die in that 0 5s So you want CVs to reload slightly faster than 20s but not so fast that the CVs strike before the barrage appears Or just be a normal person and use the other fleets</text>

      <text>read the wiki Timing precision Medium DPS check Medium Tank check Hard First read the boss skills if you haven t You must consistently interrupt Warspite every 20s and not mentioned is that her charge attack has 30k HP and finishes in 5s Let success denote your fleet successfully interrupting Warspite by dealing enough damage Let failure denote the opposite Generally a success causes your main fleet to lose a little HP and a failure causes it to lose a LOT of HP Do not expect to tank two or more failures On average the charge attack happens every ~20 05s and Warspite stops for ~8 2s shown in the chart below every ~20 45s Strategies that attempt to take advantage of her stop should consider that timing attacks to her charge attack will become desynced with her stop later in the battle One recurring strategy you will find in the following fleets is a BB excluding Alsace or Unzen with 20s reload time After one failure Warspite will blind your fleet preventing torpedos airstrikes and main fleet salvos from launching The blindness ends around the same time Warspite begins the next charge Since BBs and Unzen cannot begin reloading the next attack while holding one they will become synced with Warspite s charging for the rest of the battle Time graph for skills</text>

      <text>Unfortunately this CM is hard Try your best to copy one of the High End fleets with Helena and manual for clearing barrages or hitting stop times if you need to</text>

      <text>The least effort strategy that may randomly lose even when geared well The BBs have no sync whatsoever so they fire at arbitrary times with UvH offering frequent salvos Every 20s pray that at least one BB s salvo partially falls within the 5s charge attack window and some high DPS vanguard ships can also help reach the 30k threshold The fleet is expected to get a few interrupt failures so you should also pray that your BBs evade enough shells In fleets with non concealed ship s Warspite will fire additional AP barrages at your main fleet ships especially Musashi or the flagship These barrages chip away your BBs HP so it is a DPS race If you don t have three good vanguard ships like Eldridge Aegir Plymouth Unzen Hindenburg Guam or Helena then you could try putting a ship with Flank Defense or Flagship Cover If you put in more effort you can try to get Unzen s torpedos or one of the BBs to have around 20s reload time Then the fleet will win more consistently High End BB example fleet</text>

      <text>Because carriers except Impero can store airstrikes being blinded once by Warspite will not sync the 20s carriers to the charge attack Therefore these fleets must rely on the vanguard to deal 30k damage in 5s If you can get the vanguard damage to work then ~20s CVs with Helena should produce the fastest possible clear times Warning Unzen s 20 0s to 20 1s improved quad mag torpedos are all but required Shown here is an unoathed Unzen with 10 CA RLD tech and a 4 Autoloader yielding a faster reload than 20 0s but Unzen can be lagged or blocked so 19 98s is suitable Ideally you should find a sync with one or two oxytorps instead of autoloader The example could have put two oxytorps but the autoloader toolkit was chosen for people who win slower Shinano being the slowest of the three carriers takes defensive auxes to survive for over 5 minutes High End CV example fleet This is a 2023 video using Hakuryuu instead of Amagi CV but the idea is identical An alternate version with Admiral Nakhimov but requries very high CV RLD and damage Since there is no other Northern Parliament slow we need Royal Fortune to provide slow as well Because of the high CV reload tech after Royal Fortune leaves the CVs have caught up to Warspite s stop times</text>
