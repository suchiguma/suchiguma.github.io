      <text>A long long time ago but after EN servers beta period I was a clueless little new player I found some deteriorating and in hindsight often questionable guides on the street and perused them diligently along with the EN wiki helping me clear Chapter 12 with ease However as a casual player I fell victim to mistakes such as retiring ships after level 70 MLB for the noble but misguided ideal of clearing dock space some of the ships lost in the great purges offered key level 120 tech stats sorry Intrepid and Eskimo Sometime in late 2020 I began taking the game more seriously I farmed 12 2 and 12 4 with a 1 3 fleet and even wrote a simulation to calculate when to retreat from 12 4 for maximum ship experience gains this was before clearing rewards were added for completing the boss battle However mobilizing my account to handle the endgame content of the time proved slow and I failed to one shot Hiryuu META and Ark Royal META when Operation Siren released Fast forward a few years and it seems I ve made rather respectable progress despite my dubious beginnings Today Im hailed as one of the most eminent scholars of my field My journey proves that I I forgot the point of writing this story</text>

      <score>STANDARD</score>
      <text>Most CM s are exercises in reading and timing Oaths or exact gear levels 10 to 13 are not required unless for timing However many example fleets are timing sensitive and you often won t have the exact ships oaths gear cat RLD and RLD tech to copy them correctly Then you will need to calculate your own fleet timing To the best of our knowledge this online calculator henceforth referred to as the calculator is the only one that is precise enough for these CM timing calculations We highly recommend not being scared by it and learning how to use it on desktop If an example fleet requires 50 CV RLD with oath that means you need oathed CVs and have CV reload from tech cats 50 Alternatively it would also probably work without oaths and with CV tech cats 57 or 58 Due to how the game code loop works some boss skills boss movement patterns or ship skills can be delayed by 0 0s to 0 1s every time This is more noticeable in long battles like the game mode this guide is for Some strategies attempt to account for this delay but sometimes it can t be fixed</text>

      <text>Forgo healing and use CV screenclear to wipe the sting barrage This requires carriers to be slightly faster than 20s which is a high bar for CVs but not CVLs like Unicorn Due to the 1 5s start of battle delay if your faster CV has exactly 20 0s reload the screen clear will happen 0 5s after the boss fires the true damage barrage If your vanguard is too close to the boss due to RNG then they ll die in that 0 5s So you want CVs to reload slightly faster than 20s but not so fast that the CVs strike before the barrage appears Or just be a normal person and use the other fleets</text>

      <text>The least effort strategy that may randomly lose even when geared well The BBs have no sync whatsoever so they fire at arbitrary times with UvH offering frequent salvos Every 20s pray that at least one BB s salvo partially falls within the 5s charge attack window and some high DPS vanguard ships can also help reach the 30k threshold The fleet is expected to get a few interrupt failures so you should also pray that your BBs evade enough shells If you put in more effort you can try to get Unzen s torpedos or one of the BBs to have around 20s reload time High End BB example fleet</text>

      <text>Because carriers except Impero can store airstrikes being blinded once by Warspite will not sync the 20s carriers to the charge attack Therefore these fleets must rely on the vanguard to deal 30k damage in 5s If you can get the vanguard damage to work then ~20s CVs with Helena should produce the fastest possible clear times Warning Unzen s 20 0s to 20 1s improved quad mag torpedos are all but required Shown here is an unoathed Unzen with 10 CA RLD tech and a 4 Autoloader yielding a faster reload than 20 0s but Unzen can be lagged or blocked so 19 98s is suitable Ideally you should find a sync with one or two oxytorps instead of autoloader The example could have put two oxytorps but the autoloader toolkit was chosen for people who win slower Shinano being the slowest of the three carriers takes defensive auxes to survive for over 5 minutes High End CV example fleet</text>
